# BB84 Quantum Key Distribution

Cryptography is the process for enabling secure communication between two or more parties; often referred to as Alice and Bob. In this context, there's also a potential eavesdropper named Eve, whose presence highlights the need for secure methods. This repository showcases the methodology behind the quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol known as the BB84 scheme. The main objective of this protocol is to establish a secure encryption-decryption key between Alice and Bob using the superposition principle in quantum mechanics. 

In /src/quantum you find all the functions related to the quantum part of the algorithm. After Bob measures all the bits alice sent /src/classical functions are implemented for key validation and error correcting. Finally, /src/utils functions include: xor symetric string message encryption, decryption; and the bb84 protocol itself. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine (preferably Python 3.7 or higher), as well as `pip` for package management. You'll also need Git to clone the repository. The project uses Qiskit, which requires that you have Anaconda or Miniconda installed if you do not wish to manage dependencies manually.

You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
You can download Git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
You can download Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

### Installation

First, clone the BB84 repository from GitHub to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Barroso01/Quantum-Key-Distribution-BB84.git
cd Quantum-Key-Distribution-BB84
``` 
It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage the dependencies for the project:

```bash
python -m venv bb84-env
# On Windows:
bb84-env\Scripts\activate
# On MacOS/Linux:
source bb84-env/bin/activate
```
With the virtual environment activated, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

### Examples

The examples directory contains a file (bb84_working_example.py) that ilustrates the working principles of the QKD BB84. Run the file to see the protocol in action! In the file, you can edit:
    - backend: default Aer simulator, but you can use IBMÂ´s bakend to use on real Quantum Hardware.
    - Parameters: Number of qubits, noise, evesdropper and error rate.
    - Message example: default: "A super secret message"

Notes:
1. ```bash bb84_protocol(num_qubits,backend,1,0,0) ```  configuration has errors with the backend noise_model


### Tests 

The tests directory contains two files corresponding to performance tests on functions in the directory /src.

The function bb84_performance_test.py measures key generation rate (KGR) and quantum bit error (QBER) of the bb84 protocoll. As of 2023, typical KGR have hundrends of kbps with QBER below 2% for secure key generation.

The funcrion error_correction_efficiency.py measures the efficiency; corrected bits / total error bits and the time it takes to correct a single error. 

Notes: 
1. Further implementation on error_correction_efficiency.py is needed to measure information leaking to eve with corrections.
