    """
    Simulate the BB84 protocol for quantum key distribution. The user can choose backend, noise, evesdropper and error rate.
    - First Alice generates her random bits and bases and prepares qubits.
    - Bob initializes his random bases to measure incoming qubits. 
    - For* each qubit Alice sent  
    -- If error_rate > 0, errors are introduced to the qubits before Bob or Evedropper measures them.
    -- If evesdrop = 1, an eavesdropper measures the qubits in a random basis and stores the value and generates new qubit in the measured state.
    -- Bob measures the qubit in the basis he chose.
    -- Alice and Bob compare basis and keep bits where they used the same basis.
    - Error detection by comparing both keys is performed. 

    Args:
        num_qubits (int): The number of qubits to be used for the key.
        backend (str): The backend to be used for the simulation.
        noise_measurement (bool): Whether to simulate noise on the measurement.
        evesdrop (bool): Whether to simulate an eavesdropper.
        error_rate (float): The probability (between 0/1) of an error being introduced to the system before recipient measurement.

    Returns:
        list: Alice's key.
        list: Bob's key.
